In this case the harm is intentionally self-imposed due to a lack of patience against other opponents, or as an entry fee to start playing the game.</p><p>The result of this experiment in human temperamentality is a mutually beneficial agreement for all other participants in the model based on the decision of others to break Pareto optimality by entering or leaving the contract. The most uniquely expressed benefit is in the form of passive-Ethereum income generated by fees imposed on other players liquidating their positions into, or out of the game. These fees are distributed to token holders as a form of share-based return. The resulting volume-based income adds an expressive third dimension to the standard price/time calculations that are ubiquitous in cryptocurrency today.</p>"
